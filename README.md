## Motivation

> The first motivation for this repository is to learn Rust. We have a very good feeling regarding the future of Rust so we decided to learn about the language in community.

`libcne` is a hobbist project to gather **public data available** in the CNE website.
Basically this crate, makes a request to the endpoint available in the site
used to fetch date about where a given ID (CID) belongs for voting.

## Example

The following sample is available in the `libcne/example` directory:

```rust
use libcne::request::find;
use libcne::cne::{Citizenship, Elector};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let elector_id: String = String::from("123123123");
  let elector: Elector = libcne::request::find(Citizenship::V, elector_id).await.unwrap();

  println!("{:?}", elector);
}
```
